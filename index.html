			<h1><a href="https://annahavron.micro.blog/2022/04/26/how-to-find.html">How to find inspiration for what to write about, on your blog</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://annahavron.micro.blog/2022/04/26/how-to-find.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-04-26 08:28:46 -0400">Apr 26, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Various thoughts, in response to a question about how writers find inspiration to post regular content on their blogs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What about turning the question around backwards? You don&rsquo;t have to have an idea to write. Writing is what generates ideas. If I&rsquo;m struggling for content, I just start writing: rambling, really. I set a timer or a word count, and write whatever comes to mind that fills the minutes or word count. Generally I will hit on something that energizes me enough to write more about it.</p></li>

<li><p>I made a shift in my thinking. Rather than assume that what I write is not interesting to others, I assume that somebody, somewhere, among the billions on this planet, shares the problems and interests I have. My job is to publish my thoughts, so that they can be useful to others who struggle with the same things I struggle with. I also don&rsquo;t worry about being unique or literary. I worry, instead, about making my thoughts <em>clear.</em></p></li>

<li><p>I commit to writing deadlines. Due to having had several jobs where I had to write for deadlines, often when I had no idea what I&rsquo;d write about, I KNOW that I don&rsquo;t have to have an idea to start writing. I just have to have a deadline! This is why both of my blogs have newsletter components.  I have to write something at least 1x a week for <a href="https://analogoffice.net/">analogoffice.net</a>, and I have to write something at least 1x every two weeks for <a href="https://www.annahavron.com/">annahavron.com</a>; because that&rsquo;s when the newsletters come out.</p></li>

<li><p>I commit to learning in public. I never know which posts will resonate with people. It&rsquo;s okay if something doesn&rsquo;t get much of a response; I&rsquo;m going to write more posts and maybe the next post will be something that someone finds useful. And sometimes stuff I wrote a long time ago gets a response much later. You never know.</p></li>

<li><p>I commit to AIC time. Keeping this family-friendly, I commit to putting my (backside) In Chair, early every morning. When my backside is in the writing chair, it is time for me to write. I have AIC time 5 times a week. If I am not writing during AIC time, I am not allowed to do anything else. So, yeah, sometimes I just sit there staring at a screen, but usually something will occur to me.</p></li>

<li><p>I carry a notebook everywhere I go, because some ideas that energize me come to me when I am out on a walk or doing the dishes or ironing stuff. And then I regularly review that notebook.</p></li>

<li><p>I have a couple of topics I&rsquo;m obsessive about. I blog so I don&rsquo;t bore my IRL family and friends to tears with my personal obsessions. If they want to read it, they can; but it&rsquo;s an outlet for me.</p></li>

<li><p>If I don&rsquo;t write, I&rsquo;m miserable, which is tedious, and an own-goal, besides. Because I know this about myself, I look at writing like I look at getting out for a walk. If I want to be energized for the day, I have to write first thing in the morning, and I have to get out for a walk. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m crabby. Since I hate being crabby, I write and I walk.</p></li>
</ul>

			 <p>We find what we are looking for:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t very many toys in the prehistoric archaelogical record. For a long time, archaelogists thought that was because prehistoric kids were somehow fundamentally different from modern kids. But now some scholars think that the toys are missing from the record simply because early archaeologists didn&rsquo;t recognize them. Whenever they saw objects that could easily be used for children&rsquo;s play, they categorized them as items used for ritual instead.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>My husband grew up in suburbia. I grew up in the country. As we were driving through rural Virginia, I explained to him that trucks and cars per household in the country, are like cats per household in suburbia. If you have one, that&rsquo;s not enough - you can&rsquo;t just have one. Two or three, that&rsquo;s unremarkable. Four &ndash; eh &ndash; that can go either way. But once you have five or more vehicles in your driveway in the country and/or five or more cats at your suburban home, then people start to notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got eleven of them, twelve if you count the one buried in the yard.&rdquo; Seeing my interest, she added, &ldquo;And I got two possums, three raccoons, and a couple of rats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told me that one of the raccoons comes up to the sliding door because she feeds it hot dogs.</p>

<p>KOLBERT: Well, I quote a biologist named Phil Pister, who was instrumental in saving the Devils Hole pupfish and other very, very endangered fish.

			 <p>So when we screened in the catio last summer, we <em>neglected to notice</em> the <a href="https://www.almanac.com/praying-mantis-predator-garden">praying mantis</a> egg case <em>inside</em> the porch. Luckily, our daughter used to work at an entomology lab. Here is my heroic family moving 300 or so mantids to the garden. We kept finding mantises for the rest of the summer; and they too got ferried to the yard.</p>

			 <p>Vacation in late August, to a quiet beach cottage. This was one of the strangest cloud formations I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Maybe it was <a href="https://www.surfertoday.com/environment/kelvin-helmholtz-the-clouds-that-look-like-breaking-waves">this phenomenon</a>.</p>
